### What is Suricata?
:::info Suricata
Suricata is an open-source, high-performance, network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS), developed and maintained by the Open Information Security Foundation (OISF).

---
### Modes of Operation
It can operate in the following modes:
#### 1. Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
- As an IDS, Suricata passively monitors network traffic and alerts administrators when it detects malicious activity, such as malware, unauthorized access attempts, or policy violations. 
- These alerts can be logged and sent to other systems for further analysis.

#### 2. Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
- In IPS mode, Suricata takes an active role. 
- Instead of just alerting, it can be configured to drop or block malicious packets and connections, effectively preventing an attack from reaching its target. 
- This provides a proactive defense mechanism against cyber threats.

#### Network Security Monitoring (NSM)
- Beyond simple threat detection, Suricata offers deep insights into network activity. 
- It can log a wide range of information about network sessions, including file extractions, TLS/SSL certificates, DNS queries, HTTP requests, and more. 
- This detailed logging capability makes it an invaluable tool for forensic analysis and threat hunting.

### Key Architectural Features
Suricata's modern design gives it significant advantages over older IDS/IPS solutions:

##### Multi-threading and High Performance
- Unlike many traditional systems that are single-threaded, Suricata is built from the ground up to be multi-threaded. 
- This allows it to leverage multiple CPU cores, enabling it to process large volumes of network traffic at very high speeds, making it suitable for high-bandwidth networks.

##### Rule-Based Engine
- Suricata's detection logic is driven by a powerful and flexible rule engine. 
- It uses a human-readable rule format that allows security professionals to define patterns for identifying specific threats. 
- It is compatible with and can use rules from popular rule sets like the Emerging Threats Open and the VRT (Snort) rule sets.

##### Protocols and Layer-7 Analysis
- Suricata can analyze traffic at the application layer (**Layer 7** of the OSI model), understanding protocols like HTTP, DNS, TLS, SMB, and others. 
- This deep protocol inspection allows it to detect threats that might be hidden within seemingly normal network traffic.

##### File Extraction
- One of Suricata's unique features is its ability to extract and save files transmitted over the network. 
- This is incredibly useful for malware analysis, as it allows security teams to obtain a copy of a malicious file and analyze it in a controlled environment.

### Integration and Ecosystem
- Suricata is not just a standalone tool. It is designed to integrate seamlessly into a broader security ecosystem. Its output can be easily consumed by other tools for:

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): Suricata's alerts and logs can be sent to SIEM systems like Splunk, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), or Graylog for centralized correlation and analysis.

- Packet Capture and Analysis: It can work in conjunction with tools like Wireshark for more detailed packet-level investigations.

- Management Interfaces: Various open-source and commercial front-ends and dashboards exist to manage Suricata rules and analyze its output, such as the Suricata-GUI or Kibana dashboards.
### How is Suricata Used in Real Life?
